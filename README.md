# Scarpet UHC
Scarpet UHC is a cool little scarpet app that let you play simple and fun UHCs with your friends. This app was **not** designed for big servers but as a simpler alternative to sometimes complex plugins, in an environnement that allows modding and more.

## Installing Scarpet UHC
Running this app will of course require you have carpet installed on your server, which you can download [here](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet), along with all of its installation instructions.

To install the app just drag it into the `scripts` folder you the world that you want to use. The file should be at `/world/scripts/scarpet_uhc.sc`. If you plan to use the world generator app, add `world_generator.sc` in the same folder.
